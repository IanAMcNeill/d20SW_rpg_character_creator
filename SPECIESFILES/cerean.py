# Cerean descriptions, traits and bonuses

description = "DESCRIPTION : \n \"Cereans come from a remote Utopian world. Most are peaceful, following farming traditions that date back thousands \
    of years. The species includes more females than males, and their society is matriarchal. Their high-domed heads hold binary brains, and two hearts\
    beat in a Cerean's chest. With a non-aggressive heritage, it is only rarely that a Cerean develops the desire to adventure, and even more rare\
     that one takes up the robes of a Jedi Knight.\" "

personality = "PERSONALITY : \n \"Tend to be calm, rational, and extremely logical\" "

physicality = "PHYSICAL DESCRIPTION : \n \"Average about 2 meters in height, with elogated craniums. They have a maturity rate and life span similar\
     to that of Humans.\""

example_names = "EXAMPLE NAMES : \n \"Ki-Adi, So Leet, Sylvn, Ti-Dal, Maj-Odo.\"" 

adventuring = "WHY THEY VENTURE OUT: \n \"Would be adventurers do so in direct contradiction to their traditions and beliefs. Aggression is \
    a last resort only after all peaceful solutions are attempted. Their binary brains allow them to give equal weight to two different sides \
    of an argument. A Force-user will often contemplate the light side and dark side simultaneously.\""
