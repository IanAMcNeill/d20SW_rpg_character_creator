# d20SW_rpg_character_creator
A character generator for STAR WARS D20. 

I wanted to create a simple program that could be used to create a basic character sheet for Star Wars D20 Revised Edition.

Though there are many other gametypes out there and this RPG is outdated, I felt that it would make a good intro project
for PYTHON. 

The program uses text from the book for character and species descriptions.

This project is not complete but is well on its way. 

Update as of 12/13/2020:
- Delete the file in the py_cache folder after downloading. It was only needed on GIT to make the directory.

-Known Errors and Crashes: 

  - Choosing a separate species other than Bothan, Duro, Human, and Cerean
  - Mispelling any of the names mentioned in this document. 
  - Choosing any classes other than FRINGER. (others are in the works)
